# Weather Dashbord

The weather  dashboard is a user-friendly application that provides a convenient way for travelers to plan their trips by seeing the weather for different cities. The application utilizes a weather API to gather and display the weather data.

## Key Features
Search for a city to view its current weather conditions, including the city name, date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

View the 5-day forecast for a city, which includes the date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, and humidity.
Add a city to the search history, which allows users to easily access the current and future weather conditions for that city in the future.

## Challenges
The main challenge in this project was accessing and properly displaying the data from the weather API. It was necessary to use the city's longitude and latitude to retrieve the weather data, which required a deeper understanding of API usage and data manipulation. Additionally, formatting and displaying the 5-day forecast in an organized and intuitive way was also a challenge.

## Things Learned
In completing this project, I learned how to effectively access and utilize data from an API. I also gained a deeper understanding of how to manipulate and display data on a web page. Additionally, I learned how to use form inputs and create a search history feature. Overall, this project has helped me improve my skills in web development and API usage.
